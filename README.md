## Wishlist

This application serves as a way for users to create holiday wishlists to share with their friends and family. Users can view the wishes that others make, mark items as purchased, and network with other users.

This application was built as a tutorial series to help others learn more about the Laravel framework and how test driven development works.

You can view the entire tutorial series [here](https://blog.daydevelops.com/series/3) and check out a live demo of the application [here](https://wishlist.daydevelops.com).
